# Smart-Flood-Detector
Ideated and designed a smart flood detection system capable of sending prior alerts to citizens. This idea is hardware-centric and involves sensors that assess environmental conditions and transmit real-time data to a central processor. This processor can compute flood probability using real-time data and rainfall predictions. Communication to the citizens is also thought out in the project.

This was a part of our team's design thinking assignment at Texas Instruments' WiSH Mentorship program.
